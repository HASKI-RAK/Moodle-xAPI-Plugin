# Guide to Changing Statements
So you've found a statement that you'd like to change. If you're not comfortable with PHP or can't get to grips with Moodle's logstore, then you should probably ask for the change in a new issue via [our Github issue tracker](https://github.com/xAPI-vle/moodle-logstore_xapi/issues) and hopefully someone will have some time to make the changes you require.

If PHP and the logstore aren't scaring you away ü§ò, then the first thing you need to do is [install the plugin using Git](install-with-git.md). Once you've installed the plugin using Git, all of the code in this Git repository will be in the "admin/tool/log/store/xapi" directory path from the root directory of your Moodle installation.

Now hold your horses üèá, before you dive in and edit some code, we need to do a bit of house keeping so that your changes are easy to review and more likely to get merged. Open up your terminal, change to the directory of the plugin ("admin/tool/log/store/xapi"), and then create a new Git branch for your modifications using `git checkout master && git pull && git checkout -b A_BRANCH_NAME_FOR_YOUR_CHANGES`.

With the house keeping taken care of you now need to track down the transformer for the statement. We've tried to make tracking this down a piece of cake üç∞, if you look at the statement you'd like to change, you should see that inside the `statement.context.extensions` there is a property with the URL of `http://lrs.learninglocker.net/define/extensions/info`. Inside that property is a property called `event_function` and the value of that will be something like `\\src\\transformer\\events\\mod_quiz\\attempt_submitted`. This value is the file path to the function that transforms the logstore event into an array of xAPI statements. If you look inside [the `src` directory of the plugin](../src) you should be able to follow this file path to the function that you'll need to change. For the value above that takes you to [the `attempt_submitted` transformer](../src/transformer/events/mod_quiz/attempt_submitted.php).

Once you've tracked down the transformer, make the changes you require and then test those changes by running `./vendor/bin/phpunit` in your terminal from inside the plugin directory. You'll probably need to change the tests a little in order for them to pass since the tests check the properties and values of the statement. To change the tests, take a look in [the `tests` directory of the plugin](../tests), you'll find that it's structured very similarly to [the `src/transformer` directory](../src/transformer). You should also notice that each test is made up of 4 files, this is explained in [our testing guide](testing.md).

When you've got those pesky tests passing again ‚úÖ, it's time to commit your changes and make a pull request. To commit all of your changes you can run `git add -A && git commit -am "A_DESCRIPTION_OF_YOUR_CHANGES && git push"`. To make a pull request you can follow [Github's guide for creating a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/). Once your pull request is made, your changes will be reviewed and merged by a maintainer.

If you're having some issues with this guide, we're really sorry üòû and we'd like to improve it for you, so please create a new issue on [our Github issue tracker](https://github.com/xAPI-vle/moodle-logstore_xapi/issues).
