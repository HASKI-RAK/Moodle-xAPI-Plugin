# Installing with the downloaded plugin
If you're here, it's probably because zip installation is disabled for your Moodle instance, if that's not the case, we recommend you [install with the zip file](install-with-zip.md). If zip installation is disabled you can follow the steps below to get the plugin installed on your Moodle instance.

1. Download the "xapi.zip" file from [the latest release](https://github.com/xAPI-vle/moodle-logstore_xapi/releases/latest).
1. Unzip the downloaded "xapi.zip" file and move the contents into the `admin/tool/log/store` directory from the root of your Moodle directory.
1. Finally you can [configure and enable the plugin](enable-the-plugin.md).

If you're having some issues with this guide, please create a new issue on [our Github issue tracker](https://github.com/xAPI-vle/moodle-logstore_xapi/issues).
