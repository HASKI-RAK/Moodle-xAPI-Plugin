# Installing with the ZIP file
Before we begin installing the plugin, you of course need to have [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) installed first and you need to be logged in to your Moodle instance as an admin. If zip installation is disabled, you can use our [download installation guide](install-with-download.md), otherwise you can follow the steps below.

1. Download the "xapi.zip" file from [the latest release](https://github.com/xAPI-vle/moodle-logstore_xapi/releases/latest).
1. Go to "http://your.moodle/admin/tool/installaddon/index.php".
1. Drag and drop the ZIP file.
1. Click "Install plugin from the ZIP file".
1. Click “Install plugin!”.
1. Finally you can [configure and enable the plugin](enable-the-plugin.md).

If you're having some issues with this guide, please create a new issue on [our Github issue tracker](https://github.com/xAPI-vle/moodle-logstore_xapi/issues).
